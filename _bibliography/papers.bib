      abstract = {This paper considers neural representation through the lens of active inference, a normative framework for understanding brain function. It delves into how living organisms employ generative models to minimize the discrepancy between predictions and observations (as scored with variational free energy). The ensuing analysis suggests that the brain learns generative models to navigate the world adaptively, not (or not solely) to understand it. Different living organisms may possess an array of generative models, spanning from those that support action-perception cycles to those that underwrite planning and imagination; namely, from "explicit" models that entail variables for predicting concurrent sensations, like objects, faces, or people - to "action-oriented models" that predict action outcomes. It then elucidates how generative models and belief dynamics might link to neural representation and the implications of different types of generative models for understanding an agent's cognitive capabilities in relation to its ecological niche. The paper concludes with open questions regarding the evolution of generative models and the development of advanced cognitive abilities - and the gradual transition from "pragmatic" to "detached" neural representations. The analysis on offer foregrounds the diverse roles that generative models play in cognitive processes and the evolution of neural representation.}

abstract = {Railway traffic management requires a timely and accurate redefinition of routes and schedules in response to detected perturbations of the original timetable. To date, most of the (automated) solutions to this problem require a central authority to make decisions for all the trains in a given control area. An appealing alternative is to consider trains as intelligent agents able to self-organize and determine the best traffic management strategy. This could lead to more scalable and resilient approaches, that can also take into account the real-time mobility demand. In this paper, we formalize the concept of railway traffic self-organization and we present an original design that enables its real-world deployment. We detail the principles at the basis of the sub-processes brought forth by the trains in a decentralized way, explaining their sequence and interaction. Moreover, we propose a preliminary proof of concept based on a realistic setting representing traffic in a French control area. The results allow conjecturing that self-organizing railway traffic management may be a viable option, and foster further research in this direction.}
