I'm a Ph.D. student at [ISTC-CNR](https://www.istc.cnr.it/en), the Institute for Cognitive Sciences and Technologies of the National Research Council of Italy.

I'm mainly interested in AI and Neuroscience. I'm a member of the [CONAN Lab](https://www.istc.cnr.it/it/group/conan-0) and, under the supervision of [Dr. Giovanni Pezzulo](https://sites.google.com/site/giovannipezzulo/), I'm currently working on cognitive maps learning by rodents navigating in a maze. 

I previously worked on Mean Field Games under the supervision of Prof.[François Delarue](https://math.unice.fr/~delarue/) at [Université Côte d’Azur](https://univ-cotedazur.fr/).
