<h1 id="research-activity">Research Activity</h1>

<p>I’m currently a Ph.D student at the <a href="https://www.istc.cnr.it/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISTC-CNR</a>, the Institute for Cognitive Sciences and Technologies of the Italian National Research Council.</p>

<p>My research goal is to explore the topic of multi-agent systems in which agents are endowed with deep cognitive skills.</p>

<p>This topic is an intersection of two well-established research areas here at IST-CNR: computational neuroscience and swarm intelligence.</p>

<p>For what concerns computational neuroscience, I’m a member of the <a href="https://www.istc.cnr.it/en/group/conan-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cognition in Action (CONAN) Lab</a>, an interdisciplinary group that studies cognitive processing in humans and animals by combining experimental studies with computational modeling and cognitive robotics. The lab mainly deals with goal-directed decision-making, probabilistic models of brain and cognition, social interaction and joint action and the grounding of higher cognitive skills in sensorimotor prediction.
Furthermore, the group actively collaborates with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_J._Friston" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Karl Friston</a> who developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Inference Framework</a> - the framework I have in mind when I speak about agent’s deep cognitive skills. In fact, active inference is a way of understanding sentient behavior - a theory that characterizes perception, planning, and action in terms of probabilistic inference - and provides an integrated perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior that is increasingly used across multiple disciplines including neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy.</p>

<p>For what concerns swarm intelligence, I collaborate with <a href="https://www.istc.cnr.it/en/people/vito-trianni" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vito Trianni</a>, an experienced researcher in the field of self-organisation, complex systems, collective adaptive systems and swarm robotics.</p>

<p>Hence, in my future research activity, I would like to understand how cognitive processes like attention, decision making or categorisation emerge in a system from the numerous interactions among the system components, possibly organised in complex network topologies. The insights gathered will be then exploited to synthesise cyber-physical systems like robot swarms to optimally deal with the complexity inherent to real-world applications.</p>

<p>A real-wold application that will be investigated along with my research is offered by the <a href="https://jpi-urbaneurope.eu/project/sortedmobility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SORTEDMOBILITY project</a> I’m involved in. This project proposes a holistic approach for self-organizing management of public transport in urban and interurban areas, focusing on rail as mobility backbone. Simulations will assess the self-organization approach in case studies in Denmark, Italy and France. They will integrate advanced methods for passenger demand prediction and rail traffic modelling. In a close collaboration between academic ( Universite Gustave Eiffel – Technical University of Denmark – ISTC-CNR – Delft University of Technology) and key rail stakeholders (Société nationale SNCF – Rete Ferroviaria Italiana – BaneDanmark), SORTEDMOBILITY will showcase the future of railways while producing guidelines and recommendations to support future public transport systems.</p>

<p>To summarise, as starting point, I will study multi-agent systems in which each agent is an active inference agent. This means that each agent will be able to perceive, plan, and act according to the probabilistic inference model described in the active inference framework. The results of this investigation will be then applied to self-organizing trains in the SORTEDMOBILITY project. 
As second step, I will give to single agents the ability to learn and I will study how they influence each other when they learn while interacting. The learning component has already been studied in active inference in the case of a single agent but almost nothing has been done in the multi-agent scenario. 
At this point, it will be also extremely interesting to compare this approach to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reinforcement Learning (RL)</a>. In fact active inference has several advantages over RL, e.g. it naturally solves the exploration-exploitation trade-off problem typically arising in RL, but it also has some disadvantages, e.g. it requires the knowledge of environment’s dynamics in its classical formulation.</p>

<p>In the end, it could sound as an ambitious research plan but I’m just at the beginning of my Ph.D and I have extremely expert supervisors and colleagues that will support me along the way.</p>

<p>Besides my research activity, I am also interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Natural Language Processing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High Performance Computing</a>. I worked for one year as Data Scientist in the NLP field and I was in charge of developing and applying NLP techniques to automatically monitor, in real time, the reputation of one of our customers on social networks. My tasks included social listening, data cleaning and analysis, sentiment and emotion analysis, text classification, clustering, anomaly detection and smart alerting in case of reputational crisis. In performing these tasks, I had the opportunity to closely collaborate with data engineers and I have learnt the basics of cloud computing.</p>
